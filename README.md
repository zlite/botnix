# The operating system for intelligent robotic systems

## Announcements

* *Hello, world!* We have launched after a year in research and development.
* `Botnix` works out-of-the-box using standard `NixOS` conventions and is currently in active development.
* We are working on our first major release: `Botnix 1.0 Torbj√∂rn` (pronounced *torr-beyourn*, meaning "Bear of Thor")
* Join us in building the future of robot operating systems!

## Introduction

`Botnix` is the first operating system (OS) and Linux distribution for multi-agent and -domain
*autonomous systems*, *intelligent robotic systems*, or [*embodiment*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04918)
as it is known in the artificial intelligence (AI) research community. `Botnix` stands for
"Robot Linux" or "Robotics Linux". **Our goal is to create the ideal OS for intelligent robotic
systems in-the-wild**, built on the widely deployed and field-tested Linux kernel and the
powerful Nix [software deployment model](https://edolstra.github.io/pubs/phd-thesis.pdf).
`Botnix` provides the `Botpkgs` or "Bot packages" software repository, a domain-specific subset
of the 80,000+ packages found in the [Nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs/) repository.
`Botnix` is a single-purpose, battle-hardened variant of `NixOS` using the same declarative
design. It is a production-grade OS that supports state-of-the-art research in AI for robotics.

`Botnix` is designed with the future in mind. As a community of
[Builders](https://a16z.com/its-time-to-build/), we aim to accelerate the development and
deployment of AI for robotics. The `Botnix` software and community are free and open-source.
We welcome contributions from all individuals, organizations, and industries. *We are grateful
for your support!*

## Background

While compute and energy constraints have historically limited
robotic systems to legacy real-time OSes running on underpowered microcontrollers, these
constraints are rapidly vanishing with development of new low-power 
[processor architectures](https://riscv.org/),
[domain-specific accelerators](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3350755.3400252),
[unified memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12149), and
[high-speed interconnects](https://www.uciexpress.org/), as demonstrated by the
[NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/),
[Apple M1 system-on-chip (SoC)](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/apple-unleashes-m1/),
and [AMD chiplet technology](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9499852). This
revolution in computing is powering a new Age of Embodied Intelligence. *We aim to be the
operating system (OS) of the robotics revolution*.

**Embodied AI**: `Botnix` is intended to be the first OS with native, batteries-included
support for robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) at both the high- and low-level. We
aim to bring the robotics and AI software ecosystems out of piecemeal, standalone packages
and libraries and into a cohesive whole at the OS level. This includes boilerplate
interfaces necessary to communicate between popular software systems used in different
robotics domains. We further aim to provide tools for physical intuition, such as real-time
internal physics engines for hybrid neurosymbolic AI inference.

**RoboDevSecOps**: `Botnix` aims to be the ideal OS for AI and robotics developer-security-operations
or [RoboDevSecOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/devsecops/), as the safety of deployed systems
is a primary consideration in AI and robotics alike. More than a package manager, the powerful
[Nix system](https://nixos.org/) enables us to provide a simple, declarative, stateful,
reproducible OS with native depedency isolation (think of it as built-in containers),
cloud over-the-air (OTA) updates, and rollbacks. We aim to buttress this system with robust
kernel-hardening, penetration testing, monitoring, and CVE notification systems.

**Inclusive Community**: Any open-source project is only as good as its community. To
make our shared vision a reality, we are creating a new community of talented contributors.
We strive to create a community where all individuals, organizations, and viewpoints are
welcome. We default to protecting your rights. To do so, we ask that all contributors make
an effort to comply with the same well-defined [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Unlike other communities, we are not here to censor your speech by a set of abtrirary,
ill-defined rules. Your voice matters to us. *We want your opinions*.

## Why Botnix?

Like many of you, we are thrilled about recent advances in open-source AI and robotics,
but have run across some challenges along the way:

1. The [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://www.ros.org/) is not an OS at all, but
   rather, a collection of software packages. Getting ROS installed and configured for a
   particular OS can be a hassle. This increases the time needed to get up and running.
   ROS also provides no little to no tools to manage robot sofware deployment, requiring
   third-party tools with additional complexity and constraints.
2. [RoboStack](https://robostack.github.io/) is a step in the right direction by using
   the Conda package manager for dependency management in C/C++ and Python projects.
   Unfortunately, it is an incomplete solution that introduces yet another package manager
   to be managed.
3. Configuring a machine for AI development and/or deployment can still be a significant
   burden. Common challenges include installing mutually compatible graphics drivers, CUDA
   libraries, and deep learning frameworks. An entirely separate package manager such as
   [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) or 
   [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is often used for dependency
   management. If we begin with the 'right' package manager (e.g., `Nix`), all of this added
   complexity becomes unnecessary.
4. Popular flight control system (FCS) software (e.g., ArduPilot, PX4, BetaFlight) projects
   remain focused on microcontroller-based real-time OSes for unmanned aircraft systems (UAS).
   ArduPilot and PX4 are based on [ChibiOS](https://www.chibios.org/dokuwiki/doku.php) and
   Apache [NuttX](https://nuttx.apache.org/), respectively, two hard real-time OSes designed
   for microcontrollers. Because of this, ArduPilot- and PX4-based systems still must rely
   on separate Linux companion computers for the heavy lifting. *This is not the way*.
5. [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) 12 ("bookworm") is our favorite release to date, but it
   remains a traditional Linux OS poorly suited to our use case.
6. While [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/robotics/) is the most popular Linux OS, and Ubuntu Core
   is intended for robotics among other things, it has all of the limitations of Debian plus
   proprietary Snaps, a closed source, and a high price. *Robotics should be open to everyone*.
7. [The Yocto Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) and the related
   [OpenEmbedded layers for ROS](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros) is a major step in the
   right direction, but OSes must be hand-crafted and lack the powerful Nix system for
   configuring and deploying robotic systems, which we call RoboDevSecOps.
8. [OSTree](https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/) is yet another solution designed without
   robotics in mind that must be arduously adapted to our use case.
9. [GNU Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/) is the next best thing to `NixOS` with some theoretical
   advantages. In practice though, we found `Guix` to be less reliable and supported than
   `NixOS`. While the potential there, we were more comfortable moving forward with the large
   and rapidly growing `Nix` community.
10. Although we love unikernels or Library operating systems (libOSes), they are often
   slow and painful to deploy using common tools. Certaintly, automation can alleviate
   much of this headache and thankfully `Nix` does just that. That's right, [you can use `Nix`
   to build and deploy `MirageOS` unikernels](https://tarides.com/blog/2022-12-14-hillingar-mirageos-unikernels-on-nixos/). The two systems are not mutually
   exclusive.

After careful consideration, we decided that the focus of `Botnix` substantially differs from
that of `NixOS` and other communities, given our sole focus on AI for robotics. There are
numerous drivers and applications that are relevant to a general-purpose OS, but not to our
use case. Removing this overhead allows us to be more efficient. We want to accelerate robotics,
and to do so, we must be focused.

Last, we felt that the Apache 2.0 license might be better suited to commercial adoption.
